DEAR SHAREHOLDER This is the first annual report of the Avesco Group since we disposed of our investment in Complete Communications Corporation Limited (\"Complete\") and then acquired Avesco plc.

At the end of the financial year to we acquired Fountain Studios, the UK\\'s largest independent dedicated television studio and home to a number of the country\\'s top entertainment shows. In December we completed the planned disposal of our shareholding in Complete to 2waytraffic N.V. for which we received in cash, of deferred consideration and shares in 2waytraffic. At the end of September the Company disposed of its entire holding in 2waytraffic at a share, raising proceeds of In May we completed the acquisition of Avesco plc for a total consideration (including costs) of through a combination of cash and the issue of new ordinary shares of the Company. The primary business of Avesco plc and its subsidiary companies is the rental of video and audio equipment and the provision of services to the events and broadcast industry. With the addition of the Avesco companies to the Fountain Studios business, the Group has become a leading international media services business with operations in Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia and some employees.

SHARE CAPITAL Since the year end, the Company used 1m from the proceeds of the sale of its 2waytraffic shares for the purchase of its own shares by buying shares at each. These shares are held in treasury. The Directors intend to use up to the remaining from the sale of the 2waytraffic shares to undertake additional market purchases of the Company\\'s own shares although they only propose to do so if satisfied that such purchases would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of the shareholders generally.

AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE\\'S REVIEW OF OPERATIONS IAN MARTIN Avesco Group\\'s strategy is clear and straightforward to continue to grow our share of the events and broadcast market while maximising the value derived from each client relationship to the mutual benefit of the client and us. I have no doubt that we shall look back in a few years and see the last year as not only one of transformation but also as one of the emergence of the Avesco Group as a world class business within its sector. Perhaps a great deal remains to be done to maximise the potential but that is also the opportunity. WHAT WE DO For those looking at the accounts for the first time, the primary business of the Avesco Group is the supply of specialist equipment, facilities and services to the events and broadcast markets. Within the Avesco Group our clients have access to companies with all the necessary skills and experience in staging and supporting events and in providing broadcast services and facilities, companies with strong and distinctive cultures of their own and all highly respected. Today we employ around people in locations and are truly local, national and international in our capability. The largest business is Creative Technology (\"CT\"), which has operations in the US, UK, Mainland Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It is one of the premier staging companies in the world, offering highly specialised video and audio solutions to its clients. CT\\'s reputation is built on a track record established over years for delivering quality, innovation and technically challenging solutions in many countries round the globe. Alongside CT, we offer a number of regionally strong full service businesses providing a \"one stop shop\" for everything a client would need for its next event, whether a desktop projector for a boardroom meeting or a complete vision, sound and light solution for a major international event. Our third area of activity is Broadcast Services where we have two distinct businesses, Presteigne Broadcast Hire and Fountain Studios. Presteigne is a leading provider of broadcast television equipment and systems solutions to the television studio, outside broadcast and production sectors. Fountain Studios, based in Wembley, London, is the UK\\'s largest independent dedicated television studio. STRATEGY OVERVIEW Avesco Group\\'s strategy is clear and straightforward to continue to grow our share of the events and broadcast market while maximising the value derived from each client relationship to the mutual benefit of the client and us. We aim to develop the quality and range of our services and products and to exploit and build upon the substantial knowledge, skills and resources available within the Group. REVIEW OF BUSINESS The financial information, which follows for each business, covers the period since its acquisition on except in respect of Fountain Studios which has been part of the Group for the full year. The summer period has historically been the quietest part of the financial year and therefore the bare numbers alone do not adequately reflect the true underlying performance of the newer companies within the Group. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY Creative Technology (\"CT\") is a professional full service audio visual staging company providing turnkey solutions for corporate and special events, tradeshows and exhibits, conferences and general sessions, product launches and award ceremonies. CT has offices in North America (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Las Vegas), Europe (London and Stuttgart), Middle East (Dubai) and Asia (Shanghai). CT\\'s planned geographic diversification has continued with the new offices opening in Dubai and, after the year end, in Shanghai. We consolidated our position in CT Germany by buying the minority interest in the business previously owned by management. The acquisition not only gives us full ownership and control but also provides us with a solid platform from which to drive the development of that business in the very important German market. In the ½ month period for which it was part of the Group, CT achieved global revenues of and an operating loss of although it should be noted that these results take in the summer season, which is traditionally CT\\'s weaker trading period, and are after the initial trading loss in the new Dubai office of Efficient operations are a cornerstone for the CT business. We have begun an investment process to upgrade and standardise our core equipment management systems across CT. This should produce better utilisation of our equipment and thus, in turn, lead to improvements in our margins. The North American operations are scheduled to be the first to go live with the new systems during the first half of CT has continued to invest in the development of its audio capability, which generates an increasing percentage of our revenues. We have steadily grown one of the most respected audio operations in the industry in a matter of a few years. Since the end of the financial year we have entered into a strategic alliance in the music touring market with CT Touring. CT Touring will be positioned as a high-end video services company, providing concert touring video systems to some of the world\\'s most talented entertainers. CT has been trading successfully for over years and is one of the few truly international staging companies. It is run by professional management and has many talented individuals. The services offered are being broadened and geographic expansion into the Middle East and China gives us exposure to enormously important new markets. FULL SERVICE In the ½ month period for which they were part of the Group, Avesco\\'s Full Service companies, which comprise three regionally strong businesses, had combined revenue of and recorded a small operating profit. OUR BUSINESSES > Creative Technology (\"CT\"), has operations in the US, UK, Mainland Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It is one of the premier staging companies in the world, offering highly specialised video and audio solutions to its clients. > Regionally strong full service businesses provide a \"one stop shop\" for everything a client would need for its event, whether a boardroom meeting or major international event. > Two distinct businesses, Presteigne Broadcast Hire and Fountain Studios make up our Broadcast Services sector. Presteigne is a leading provider of broadcast television equipment and systems solutions to the television studio, outside broadcast and production sectors, and Fountain Studios, based in Wembley, London, is the UK\\'s largest independent dedicated television studio. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE\\'S STATEMENT REVIEW OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Over the past twelve months the Avesco Group has changed from a business primarily focused on the management of its investments to a specialist media services business with substantial global reach. JVR, based in the Netherlands, provides comprehensive technical support for conventions, sports and music events, company presentations, television shows and fairs. JVR had an outstanding performance during the period both in financial terms and in the development of the operation. It increased market share, built upon its strong reputation in video and made significant additions to its audio services. Action, based in Monaco and Cannes, has long been established as a market leader on the Côte D\\'Azur in video and audio. The region is a favoured destination for conferences and exhibitions, which provide a healthy demand for Action\\'s services. Action has recently introduced an IT services capability which integrates especially well into the exhibition market. MCL, which has offices across the UK, is one of the UK\\'s leading suppliers of vision, sound, lighting and staging, providing a \"one stop shop\" for everything the client needs for its next event, whether it is a desktop projector for a boardroom meeting or a complete vision, sound and lighting solution for a major international event. MCL is emerging from a point of change. The business, in financial terms, has failed to meet internal targets over the last several months and so to regenerate the company we have implemented a number of senior management changes. Underperforming branches have been restructured and repositioned and MCL is now a more cohesive unit moving forward. The main Birmingham office has recently been relocated to brand new premises, which are more appropriate to the size of the operation and should lead to some cost savings and improvements in operational efficiency. Through these actions we expect to see an upturn in MCL\\'s performance as the business regains its momentum. BROADCAST SERVICES Within Broadcast Services we have two businesses, Presteigne Broadcast Hire and Fountain Studios. In the months ended which includes the results of Fountain Studios for the full year and Presteigne since May Broadcast Services achieved a combined operating profit of on revenue of Presteigne Broadcast Hire rents High Definition and Standard Definition camera equipment, Video Tape Recorders, EVS hard disk recorders, lenses, RF links and de-rig systems to its clients across Europe and the rest of the World. The strategy for Presteigne remains to consolidate its position as one of the market leaders in the rental of High Definition technology as the industry migrates to that format. During the last twelve months Presteigne has opened an office in Holland, a second office in Germany and, since the year end, a second UK office in Manchester. The increase in Presteigne\\'s geographical presence in these important local markets should open up new business opportunities as well as providing the stability that comes from a broader base of operation. Presteigne has continued the development of its services and products to support a larger customer base. The fastest growing segments of the business are our RF capability and the recently introduced audio service. In parallel to CT, Presteigne has begun an investment process to replace its core IT systems with one central system allowing for improvements in equipment management around what has developed into a larger and more complex business.

Many leading shows are produced at Fountain Studios including during the year The X Factor, Britain\\'s Got Talent, Grease and Little Miss Jocelyn. Fountain produced a record financial performance in the period, with utilisation of the studio at high levels. It continued to benefit from the industry trends in programme making. The management executed their plans efficiently and did a fantastic job in managing the increased level of demand. Investment was made to refurbish the building, which has been well received. We also began to build a high definition capability with the replacement of the whole camera stock which should benefit margins and reinforce the reputation of Fountain as the studio of choice. The fourth series of the The X Factor is currently being filmed at Fountain and should provide a solid start to what we hope will be another good year.

Avesco has a strong balance sheet with gearing of only as at and we continue to generate a healthy cash flow. We are well placed to weather any downturn should it arise and to prosper in more positive markets. The financial year should benefit from the Beijing Olympics and the European Football Championships, the combination of which has the potential to produce a strong demand for the Group\\'s services during the summer and to mitigate any downturn elsewhere in the year. CONCLUSION Over the past twelve months the Avesco Group has changed from a business primarily focused on the management of its investments to a specialist media services business with substantial global reach. As the Group expands, we are identifying many exciting and challenging new opportunities around the world, all of which gives us confidence for the future.

AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW JOHN CHRISTMAS The year has been one of significant change, containing events and transactions that have notably shaped the Company and directly affected results. The year ended was one of the most important in the Company\\'s history, containing a number of events that have significantly affected the Group\\'s results. These events, which are considered further below, were as follows; > On the Company, then known as InvestinMedia plc, sold its shareholding in Complete Communications Corporation Ltd (\"Complete\") to 2waytraffic N.V. (\"2WT\"); > On the Company completed its acquisition of Avesco plc, changed its name from InvestinMedia plc to Avesco Group plc and made significant changes to the Board; > On Medal Entertainment & Media plc (\"MEM\"), in which the Company owned a interest, announced that its shares were being suspended from trading on AIM and the appointment of administrators was being sought. DISPOSAL OF COMPLETE The key terms of the disposal of Complete in December were as follows: > Initial cash consideration of was received from 2WT, of which was used to repay borrowings; > of consideration was in accordance with the terms of the sale agreement used to subscribe for new shares in 2WT; > A further of consideration is held in an escrow account as security against potential warranty and indemnity claims by 2WT in respect of the transaction. Subject to deduction in respect of any such claims, these funds are due to be released in equal tranches on April and ; > An additional payment of in respect of the net assets of Complete as at completion, which amount was agreed and paid in September ; and > An entitlement to further payments from 2WT, comprising a share of the net receipts, if any and after costs, from the litigation commenced by a subsidiary company of Complete against The Walt Disney Company and certain related companies in the courts of California. The trial is expected to commence in The Company has received advice that if a substantial part of the proceeds from the disposal of Complete were used for the acquisition of a trading business, such as the acquisition of Avesco plc, the Company will continue to be treated as a holding company of a trading group, in which case it is likely that the gain arising on the disposal of Complete should not be subject to corporation tax, which would otherwise be chargeable at per cent. It has therefore been assumed that no tax will be payable on this gain. Since the completion of the disposal of Complete, a few matters have been identified which will result in deductions from the escrow funds although in total these are not considered to be material. However, there can be no guarantee that there will not be other deductions, either because new claims may arise or existing estimates of claims may prove to be inadequate. Nevertheless, based on the existing estimates, we have been able to record a profit in these accounts of in respect of the Complete disposal, as well as a further being the Group\\'s share of the profit made by Complete when it sold some of its own subsidiaries just prior to its own sale to 2WT. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT The shares in 2WT, which the Company had acquired pursuant to the terms of the sale of Complete, were subject to a contractual lock-in, which expired at the end of September The Company decided to realise the investment at the first opportunity and the shares were sold for in September producing a loss on investment of ACQUISITION OF AVESCO PLC The acquisition of Avesco plc on resulted in the issue of new ordinary shares of each (making a total of in issue) and a total cash consideration of Fees and other payments in connection with the transaction brought total costs up to Based on the Company\\'s share price at the time of the total consideration for the acquisition was including costs. The net assets of Avesco plc on were resulting in the creation of negative goodwill of m. This sum has been left on the balance sheet as a credit balance, to be amortised over years. It is expected that the acquisition of Avesco plc and its subsidiary companies will enable the Company to continue to be treated as a holding company of a trading group so that the gain arising on the disposal of Complete should not be subject to corporation tax and these accounts have been prepared on this basis. The Avesco plc companies, together with Fountain Studios which was acquired in September now form the Group\\'s trading core. It was for this reason that the name of the Company was changed to Avesco Group plc. Now that the balance sheet of the Group, strengthened by the Complete disposal, has been allied to some exciting audio visual services businesses, the Group should be well placed for significant growth over the coming years. MEM Within weeks of the Avesco plc merger MEM experienced cash flow difficulties and subsequently went into administration. The Group\\'s interest in MEM was in the books at and this investment has been written off in its entirety. RESULTS OVERVIEW As a consequence of the various transactions outlined above, the results for the months to include: > The results of Fountain Studios for the full year, which produced an operating profit of ; > The Group\\'s share of Complete\\'s results between and its disposal on (an operating profit before exceptional items of prior to an operating exceptional loss of m, the latter due mainly to litigation expenses); > A gain of was made on our share of the profit on the disposal of certain subsidiaries of Complete and on the disposal of Complete itself ; > The Group\\'s share of MEM\\'s results between and when MEM ceased trading, comprising an operating profit before exceptional items of an operating exceptional loss (mainly in respect of reorganisation expenses) of m, together with a further exceptional loss of m relating to the write off of the Group\\'s investment in MEM; and > The results of the businesses of Avesco plc and its subsidiaries from the date of acquisition on May until being an operating profit of Both Complete and MEM were treated as Associate Undertakings for accounting purposes. PERFORMANCE > CT saw a growth in revenue compared to the same period in the previous year. Margins grew slightly to benefiting operating results, which since acquisition amounted to a loss of m, although this is after the initial trading loss in the new Dubai office of m. > Full Service saw steady margins in the June to September period of around and revenue growth of %. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Now the balance sheet of the Group has been allied to some exciting audio visual services businesses, the Group should be well placed for significant growth over the coming years. RESULTS Turnover for the year was : ), excluding the Group\\'s share of Associate\\'s turnover of : ), producing an operating profit before operating exceptional items and goodwill amortisation of : ). Exceptional costs/gains amounted to : nil) and goodwill amortisation amounted to a credit of : nil). After taking account of interest income of : ), the profit on ordinary activities before taxation was : ). Basic earnings per share were : ), and : ) on a diluted basis. DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE The operating results (i.e. excluding exceptional costs/gains and goodwill amortisation), are considered to provide a more accurate reflection of the way in which the underlying businesses are performing and are, therefore, one of the main areas of focus for the Board. However, due to the significant changes that have occurred in the composition of the Group during the year ended these results contain very little that can be effectively compared year on year. Fountain Studios is the only business that has been owned throughout the year but even that was only acquired in September so the published comparative is unrepresentative. The summer is traditionally a quieter part of the year for audio visual service businesses. With the Avesco businesses only being acquired in May, this fact is reflected in the Group\\'s results. Over the four full calendar months since the completion of the Avesco transaction, CT saw a growth in revenue compared to the same period in the previous year. Margins grew slightly to benefiting operating results, which since acquisition amounted to a loss of m, although this is after the initial trading loss in the new Dubai office of m. The Full Service Division on the other hand saw steady margins in the June to September period of around and revenue growth of but operating results were left in line with those for the same period last year due to the increased costs associated with opening of the MCL London operation and the introduction of the new IT service in the south of France. Operating profits since acquisition amounted to a little above breakeven. In the Broadcast Services Division, Fountain Studios had a strong year with high levels of activity, including The X Factor, Britain\\'s Got Talent, Grease and Little Miss Jocelyn, which helped drive a increase in revenue compared to the previous months. The absence of the major events, which tend to occur in even years, has seen a slight reduction in revenue for Presteigne this summer which has impacted the four full calendar months since the acquisition. The start up costs of Presteigne\\'s new operation in Holland have also affected its results. Overall operating profits for the year in the Broadcast Services Division were The pre-exceptional operating profits of of Complete for the month period until its disposal in December ( for months) and of of MEM for the months until it went into administration in July ( ( m loss for months) were satisfactory in the circumstances, although the subsequent administrative receivership of MEM rendered their operating results somewhat academic. The Group\\'s continued investment in improved IT systems will enable the further development of other non-financial metrics. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT CAPITAL EXPENDITURE It remains important to invest in new equipment and technology in order to maintain the development of the Group and to meet the rapidly evolving needs of our clients. During the year the Group invested in upgraded facilities at Fountain and during the ½ months that the Avesco plc companies have been part of the Group a further has been paid in respect of other audio visual related equipment. The Board\\'s underlying philosophy is that in normal years capital expenditure should be at such a level as to leave the Group cash positive. However, part of the rationale for the acquisition of Avesco plc was to utilise the pre-acquisition balance sheet strength of the Company to allow the Avesco plc businesses to develop more quickly than they would have been able to achieve on their own. Consequently, unless market conditions dictate otherwise, capital expenditure may exceed cash generation in the initial period following the acquisition. FINANCIAL POSITION AT THE YEAR END AND SHARE BUY BACK The Group remains in a healthy financial position going into As at gearing was %. Whilst this ratio will increase as we seek to accelerate the growth of our businesses, it will remain an area of close focus for the Board and will be tightly controlled. The Group remains comfortably within its banking facilities, with a new year loan facility put in place in October Since the year end the Board decided to use some of the funds realised from the sale of the shares in 2WT to buy back ordinary shares of each in Avesco Group plc, and to hold them in treasury. These were purchased on at per share. There are now shares held in treasury, leaving the total number of voting rights in the Company currently at TAXATION Having taken advice, the Board believes that the acquisition of Avesco plc allows us not to record a tax liability in the year ended in connection with the sale of Complete. We also have the benefit of past trading losses in some territories and continue to invest in new equipment such that capital allowances enable taxes on trading results to be kept low. The continuing profitability and reliability of the results of our trading businesses allow us to record a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet at the year end amounting to This has been derived from the expected utilisation of tax losses in the future. We have also recognised a deferred tax liability of in respect of accelerated capital allowances in the Broadcast Services Division. GOODWILL The acquisition of Avesco plc gave rise to negative goodwill of m. This situation may have arisen principally due to the Company\\'s share price at the time of the acquisition probably factoring in a substantial tax payment due on the sale of Complete, whereas it is expected that this payment has now been obviated by the Avesco transaction. We have also taken the opportunity to revisit the goodwill in respect of the Fountain Studios\\' acquisition that was completed in September immediately prior to the previous balance sheet date. An independent valuation of the assets there has now been completed resulting in a adjustment to the fair value of Fountain Studios\\' fixed assets, leaving a final goodwill on acquisition balance of PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT > In the Broadcast Services Division, Fountain Studios had a strong year with high levels of activity, including The X Factor, Britain\\'s Got Talent, Grease and Little Miss Jocelyn, which helped drive a increase in revenue compared to the previous months. > The Group\\'s continued investment in improved IT systems will enable the further development of other non-financial metrics. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Avesco\\'s reputation, in terms of the service we provide, the way in which we conduct our business and the financial results which we achieve, is central to our future success The acquisition of the remaining minority stake in CT Germany, which was effective as of has also resulted in goodwill of BUSINESS RISKS Avesco\\'s business is subject to many different risk factors, which will have varying degrees of significance at any particular time. Although not an exhaustive list, management consider the most important risks and uncertainties to the business to be as follows: Economic and business cycle: The Group\\'s customers are principally corporates whose expenditure on services provided by the Group may be discretionary in nature and may therefore be affected by changes in the economic and business cycle. Avesco has sought to minimise the effect of any future economic slowdown by seeking, wherever practicable, to match major items of capital expenditure to the requirements of our largest clients, and by limiting infrastructure obligations and other capital commitments to a level appropriate to the foreseeable needs of the business, after taking account of market trends and developments. Reputation: Avesco\\'s reputation, in terms of the service we provide, the way in which we conduct our business and the financial results which we achieve, is central to our future success. Failure to meet the expectations of our clients, suppliers, employees, shareholders and other business partners may have a material adverse effect on the Group. We therefore place a strong emphasis on the quality of our service, we invest in staff training, especially in the area of health and safety, and we operate systems of risk management and internal control. Dependence on key personnel: The Group\\'s future success will be dependent on key employees and their on-going relationships with clients and suppliers. It is believed that the Group is of a size that no one individual represents a significant risk to the Group. The Group also encourages client or supplier contacts to be maintained by more than one individual. Key staff are incentivised through a mixture of sales commission, profit related bonuses and participation in the Group LTIP scheme. Main Board Directors are incentivised as detailed in the Directors\\' Remuneration Report. Technological changes: Advances in technology may bring about a significant reduction in demand for certain equipment, which will eventually become obsolete. However, the Group has an on-going hire stock replacement programme, regularly buying new equipment and selling old equipment. In addition, the range of markets in which Avesco operates allows certain equipment to be recycled for use elsewhere in the Group. Competition: Competition in the provision of services to the corporate presentation, entertainment and broadcast markets may increase significantly and this may limit the ability of the Group to maintain market share or revenue levels. Some competitors may have greater access to financial resources than the Avesco Group. Although Avesco does aim to be competitive in its pricing, the Group may decline work where it is unable to make an adequate margin or where the services or equipment required are not appropriate to the Group\\'s available resources. Reliance on third party technology: Hardware and software acquired by the Group for its key activities may not operate in accordance with its specification. However, the Group generally purchases only from approved suppliers and with the benefit of relevant warranties. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT Equipment failure or loss: The Group\\'s hire stock comprises complex, high value equipment which is subject to the risks of electronic or mechanical failure as well as physical loss, damage or theft. The Group endeavours to minimise these risks through rigorous quality control measures, security precautions and insurance cover. The geographical spread of the Group\\'s businesses further reduces the potential risk which might arise from any one loss or failure. Future funding: Avesco\\'s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including its ability to operate successfully to its business model. If capital requirements vary materially from its plans, Avesco may require further financing in addition to its existing bank facilities sooner than anticipated. However, in order to minimise this risk, Avesco endeavours to build in contingencies to its financial forecasting. In addition, the Group will often have the ability to re-direct cash inflow intended for capital expenditure to other uses. Exposure to counterparty credit risk: It is believed that no one client represents a material risk to Avesco. However, where there may be a credit concern or where significant up front costs will be incurred in relation to a client\\'s event, the Group will endeavour to obtain a deposit or other security for payment. Counterparty risk with financial institutions: The Group\\'s policy is to maintain a range of types of borrowing facilities from a number of major financial institutions. Effect of foreign currency: In respect of foreign currency transactions, the Group in general does not hedge the foreign currency risk arising from sales by an operation denominated in a currency other than its functional currency. In the majority of cases, substantial deposits on such sales are received at the time of the order and the remaining balances are, to a large extent, matched by overseas costs. The exceptions to this policy are generally related to the purchase of tangible assets or other large one-off transactions where the currency risk is usually hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts. In respect of the translation of foreign currency assets, the Group endeavours to match the majority of the foreign currency asset value by funding overseas operations through borrowings or loans denominated in the overseas currency. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS Our next set of financial statements (the interims due next summer) will be prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards and will include a reconciliation to the UK GAAP statements. Whilst work in this area is still continuing, our current expectation is that there will be no major adjustments to the trading results. Similarly, although the treatment of acquisitions, goodwill and intangibles will be somewhat different, the net effect on the profit and loss account is not expected to be significant. REPUTATION > Avesco\\'s reputation, in terms of the service we provide, the way in which we conduct our business and the financial results which we achieve, is central to our future success. > We therefore place a strong emphasis on the quality of our service, we invest in staff training, especially in the area of health and safety, and we operate systems of risk management and internal control.

Shareholders\\' consent is sought to Resolutions and set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting which propose the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors of the Company and to authorise the Directors to determine the auditors\\' remuneration. By order of the Board Nicholas Conn Company Secretary AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT DIRECTORS\\' REMUNERATION REPORT As an AIM listed company, the Company is not required to comply with the Directors\\' Remuneration Report Regulations Nevertheless, the Board prefers to follow best practice and has therefore prepared the following report, which meets the majority of these regulations and which will be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This part of the Directors\\' remuneration report is unaudited. Remuneration committee Prior to the Company did not have a separate remuneration committee in view of the then small size of the Board. On the date on which the Company acquired Avesco plc, Mr Gibbins, Mr Murray, Mr Blackall and Mr Maxwell, who are all non executive Directors, were appointed to the remuneration committee and have served throughout the remainder of the year. The remuneration committee has not sought professional advice from external consultants during the year. However, the remuneration committee consults with the Chief Executive, as it considers appropriate, in relation to its proposals relating to the remuneration of the executive Directors. Remuneration policy The remuneration committee makes recommendations to the Board on the executive remuneration policy and determines specific remuneration packages for each of the executive Directors. The aim of the remuneration committee is to provide total remuneration packages which attract, retain and motivate executive Directors of the appropriate calibre. The remuneration policy is to reward excellent performance, to be commercially competitive and to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders to create value. This report sets out the Company\\'s policy on executive remuneration, its operation in the year and (although the remuneration committee is unable to confirm that the policy will continue without amendment in future years) how it is intended to be operated going forwards. It is considered that a successful policy should retain sufficient flexibility to allow account to be taken of future changes in the business environment and remuneration practice. The policy should also allow for any special arrangements which may be necessary in the future in order to recruit a director of sufficient calibre. However, any changes in the policy for future years will be described in future reports, which will be subject to shareholder approval. The principal elements of the remuneration package are as follows: Basic salary and benefits The salary of each executive Director is reviewed annually having regard to his individual responsibilities and contribution and to ensure that it is competitive with salaries of persons in equivalent positions in comparable companies. All executive Directors receive a Company car and fuel benefit (or an allowance in lieu) and are entitled to pension contributions, medical insurance cover, life assurance cover and permanent health insurance cover. Annual bonus Each of the executive Directors is entitled to a non-pensionable annual bonus which is dependent upon the achievement of short-term corporate and personal performance targets approved by the remuneration committee. The annual bonus may not exceed of basic salary. In respect of each of the year ended and the year ending the annual bonus is based on a range of personal, divisional or Group performance targets, which will differ between Directors according to their respective responsibilities and which will be measured against and conditional upon achievement of the Company\\'s internal budgets for the year. Long term incentives The Company operates an executive share option scheme (\"Option Scheme\"), which was established in and a long term incentive plan (\"LTIP\"), which was established following the acquisition of Avesco plc in (see Note in these Accounts for further details). Under the Option Scheme, which is a HM Revenue and Customs unapproved scheme, the Company granted options to its then directors in respect of a total of ordinary shares. The options are exercisable at a price of per share between and The right to exercise these options was subject to a performance condition that has now been satisfied. No further grants of options may be made under the Option Scheme. Under the LTIP, awards are made to employees under which they can receive Avesco shares at no cost to themselves based on the achievement of a pre-determined and stretching performance condition. It is intended that vested allocations will be satisfied in due course by delivery through an employee trust. No individual may receive awards in any financial year with an aggregate value at the time of grant in excess of of the employee\\'s annual basic salary although this limit may increase to of the employee\\'s basic annual salary if the remuneration committee decides that exceptional circumstances exist. No awards may be made under the LTIP more than years after its adoption. The rules of the LTIP provide that in any year period no more than of Avesco\\'s issued share capital from time to time may be issued or subject to an award or option to be issued for the purposes of the LTIP or any other employees\\' share scheme. The limit takes account of the fact that options have been granted under the Option Scheme in respect of of the issued share capital to persons who no longer perform an executive role in the Company. Accordingly, less than of the issued share capital is available for the issue of awards to executives under the LTIP. The performance condition applicable to the first awards of rights to shares made under the LTIP is that a cumulative adjusted earnings per share of at least is achieved over the three years ending The remuneration committee has discretion to adjust the earnings per share in relation to exceptional and/or non-recurring events. Subject to the rules of the LTIP and the fulfilment of the performance condition, of the shares will be released after the preliminary announcement of the results of the Company for the year ending and, subject to continuing service of the award holder, the remaining of the shares will be released on the first anniversary of that announcement date or, if later, the date of announcement by the Company of its results for the period ending It is intended that further awards will be made under the LTIP in the next months subject to the rules of the LTIP and the fulfilment of similar performance and vesting conditions as for the previous awards. Pensions Pension contributions relating to the executive Directors of the Company are paid to defined contribution arrangements and are calculated by reference to basic salary only. Annual bonuses and other benefits are not pensionable. Contracts Except as noted below, the service contracts of the executive Directors are subject to a twelve months\\' notice period by either party. It is the policy of the remuneration committee that the Company should not enter into contracts for any executive Director with rolling notice periods exceeding one year for any executive Director. The contracts of the executive Directors provide that, in the event of their termination in certain circumstances in the months following a change of control of the Company, the Director shall be entitled to a severance payment not exceeding the sum of months\\' emoluments less emoluments received since the change of control. The severance payment is triggered only in the event of termination of the Director (other than for gross misconduct) by the Company or in the event of the Company committing a material breach or making a material change to the Director\\'s detriment in the terms and conditions of the Director\\'s employment or assigning to him duties inconsistent with the position held prior to the change of control. The remuneration committee consider such a provision appropriate in order to retain the services of key executives in the event of a change of control occurring and in order to ensure an orderly transfer to an acquirer. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT Non executive Directors The remuneration of the non executive Directors is subject to a maximum aggregate limit agreed by the shareholders and set out in the articles of association. Within this limit, the remuneration of the non executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole although no non executive Director is present when his own fees are under discussion. Mr Maxwell and Mr Murray each hold options under the Option Scheme granted to them at a time when they held executive office with the Company. Subject to those grants, the non executive Directors do not participate in the share option schemes and do not receive any pension contributions or other benefits. Each of the non executive Directors has a service contract with the Company, which is capable of termination on not less than three months\\' notice.

By order of the Board Michael Gibbins Chairman of the Remuneration Committee AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT This corporate governance report sets out how the principles identified in the Combined Code have been applied by the Company in the period. Although, as an AIM listed company, the Company is not required to comply with the Combined Code, the Directors regard compliance as a benchmark of best practice, which they wish to follow wherever relevant and not disproportionate having regard to the size of the Group. Statement of compliance The Board considers that the Company has complied substantially with the provisions of the Combined Code during the period and subsequently until the date of this report. The Board The Board comprises the Directors listed on page On Mr Andrews, Mr Blackall, Mr Christmas, Mr Gibbins, Mr Martin and Mr Nicholson, who were each directors of Avesco plc, were appointed to the Board and Mr Stirling resigned as a Director. On the same date, Mr Conn was appointed as Company Secretary in place of Watlington Securities Limited. There is a non-executive Chairman, a Chief Executive Officer and a senior independent Director. Mr Gibbins, who is the Chairman, and Mr Blackall, who is the senior independent Director, are both considered to be independent of management. Mr Murray and Mr Maxwell, who are also non-executive Directors, are not considered to be independent in view of their previous involvement in an executive capacity with the Group. The Board is scheduled to meet at least four times each year, in addition to which meetings will also be convened on an ad hoc basis if there is urgent or delegated business which cannot wait until the next scheduled meeting of the full Board. The following table sets out details of the number of meetings of the Board (excluding ad hoc meetings) and of the audit and remuneration committees during the year and the attendance at those meetings: Director Total Number of meetings IP Martin GP Andrews JL Christmas DJ Nicholson MES Gibbins LNC Blackall CA Maxwell RA Murray Since appointment on Board Audit Remuneration The Board considers the overall strategic direction, development and control of the Group and reviews the financial and operational performance. Various major decisions require Board approval, including the approval of the annual budget, larger capital expenditure proposals, acquisitions and disposals. Board papers, which are sent out in advance of each meeting, include a set agenda although further subjects are added for discussion as the need arises. The executive Directors meet formally as a management team, usually on a monthly basis. These executive management meetings consider and review the operational and financial management and performance of the Group, receive reports from the key managers in respect of their respective areas of responsibility, discuss significant issues and determine any appropriate action to be taken. The Chairman and the Chief Executive have clearly established responsibilities although these have not been defined in writing. In addition to chairing the Board and the audit and remuneration committees, the Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Board is kept properly informed and is consulted on all issues reserved to it. The Chairman consults with the non executive Directors on corporate governance issues, communicates the views of the shareholders to the Board and ensures a constructive relationship between the executive and non-executive members of the Board. The Chief Executive has final executive responsibility to the Board for the success of the Group. The Board has access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and there is a written procedure for obtaining independent legal advice at the Company\\'s expense. The non-executive directors review the performance of the executive Directors, including the Chairman. No formal performance evaluation of the non-executive Directors or of the Board committees has been conducted. On appointment, new Directors take part in an induction programme when they receive information about the Group, the role of the Board and the Board committees, the Company\\'s corporate governance practices and procedures, and the latest financial information about the Group. They are also advised of their legal duties as a director of a public company. Visits are arranged to Group locations together with meetings with senior executives. The articles of association of the Company require Directors to submit themselves for re-election at the first Annual General Meeting following appointment and then every three years. Audit committee The audit committee was appointed on and now comprises Mr Gibbins, Mr Blackall and Mr Maxwell. Mr Gibbins is the current chairman of the audit committee. Mr Murray was a member of the audit committee from to when he stepped down. The audit committee reviews the Group\\'s annual report, financial statements, interim statement and preliminary announcements before recommending their approval to the Board. This process involves meeting with the external auditors to discuss issues relating to the audit and financial control of the Group. The audit committee also reviews the Company\\'s internal financial controls and risk management systems, the scope of the audit and the independence and objectivity of the auditors. The auditors have direct access, should they so require, to the chairman of the audit committee. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT Nomination committee The Company does not have a nomination committee. Any appointments to the Board would be considered by the Board as a whole. In considering the appointment of a new Director, the Board considers and defines the characteristics, qualities, skills and experience that it considers would complement the overall balance and composition of the Board. The committee may appoint an external consultant to help in the identification and recruitment of an individual who satisfies the committee\\'s criteria, unless the Board is already able to identify an appropriate individual. Directors\\' indemnities The Company has purchased insurance to cover its Directors and officers against the costs of defending themselves in legal proceedings taken against them in that capacity and in respect of any damages resulting from those proceedings. The insurance does not provide cover where the Director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company has executed a deed providing a limited indemnity to the Directors of the Company in respect of the costs of defending claims against them and third party liabilities. A copy of the deed of indemnity is available for inspection at the Company\\'s registered office during normal working hours and will also be available for inspection at the Company\\'s Annual General Meeting. Internal control The Directors have overall responsibility for internal control within the Group. The effectiveness of the Group\\'s internal control system has been reviewed by the Directors. The internal control system provides an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Company. The internal control system, which has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of this report, is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The controls in place include Group policies and procedures, which are operated in all subsidiaries and which define levels of authority and procedures for regular control and management reporting. The Group has a comprehensive system of financial reporting and forecasting covering profits, assets, liabilities, cash flow and capital expenditure. The systems include regular monitoring of cash, monthly reporting of financial results, reviews of forecasts and comparisons with budgets. Budgets and business plans are prepared annually by all operations and reviewed by management and the Board. Regular management meetings are held to monitor performance against budgets, progress in implementing planned changes and the operational efficiency of the businesses. Operational risks are identified and assessed by management with the identification and monitoring of significant risks being reported to the Board. In addition to those financial and commercial risks associated with the Group\\'s services, the nature of the services businesses dictates that particular emphasis is given to health and safety. The Group employs a full-time health and safety manager and regular training programmes are provided for operational staff. The Directors have considered the need for an internal audit function but believe that the size of the Group at present does not justify a dedicated internal audit function. However, Avesco Group finance staff make regular visits to all the operations and perform many of those risk management tasks normally associated with an internal audit function. The Directors review the decision not to have an internal audit function from time to time, in particular, having regard to material changes in circumstances. Relations with shareholders The Board makes considerable efforts to establish relationships with institutions and shareholders and to meet and communicate with them on a regular basis. Directors make institutional presentations at the time that the interim and full year results are announced. If so requested, the non-executive Directors (including the senior independent non-executive Director) are available to attend meetings with major shareholders. The Board is keen to communicate with private investors and welcomes the opportunity to meet with them at the Annual General Meeting. The Company counts all proxy votes lodged at general meetings of the Company and indicates the number of proxy votes on each resolution, after it has been dealt with by a show of hands. Information regarding the Group may be viewed on the Company\\'s website at By order of the Board Nicholas Conn Company Secretary AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS\\' RESPONSIBILITIES Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.

The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements. The Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors confirm, so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company\\'s auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken in his duty as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company\\'s auditors are aware of that information. The Group\\'s report and accounts will be published on the Group\\'s web site and in this regard the Directors accept responsibility for the maintenance and integrity of the web site, and any uncertainty arising as a result of the accounts being available via the web in different legal and accounting jurisdictions.

A summary of the more important accounting policies is set out below. These have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year with the following exceptions. Change in accounting policies The adoption of FRS20 \"Share-based payment\" resulted in the September year end numbers being restated to recognise an additional charge to the profit and loss account of in respect of outstanding share options. The charge comprises in respect of the equity value, the other side of which is a credit to reserves, and in respect of the National Insurance accrual on these options. The total recognised gains and losses since the last annual report include an adjustment of in respect of FRS20 which comprises the for the year ended and a further and for the respective equity and National Insurance charges for earlier periods. In the year ended the profit and loss account was charged in respect of the equity value and credited with in respect of the National Insurance accrual due to the Company\\'s lower closing share price. Treasury shares of : ) have been reclassified as a deduction against the profit and loss account as required by FRS25 \"Financial Instruments: Disclosure and presentation\". Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries made up to September annually. The consolidated financial statements also include the Group\\'s share of the results of associated undertakings in the period to September and share of net assets at that date. The results of new businesses or subsidiary undertakings acquired are included from the date control passes to the Group and the results of businesses or subsidiary undertakings disposed are included up to the date control passes from the Group. All intra Group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Company profit and loss account The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from presenting its own profit and loss account in accordance with section ) of the Companies Act The retained profit for the year of the Company was : loss ). Deferred taxation Full provision is made for deferred tax liabilities arising from accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition for tax purposes (except as otherwise required by FRS19: Deferred tax). Assets are also recognised in full subject to them being regarded as more likely than not to be recoverable. Deferred tax balances are not discounted. Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities, and the assets and liabilities of overseas operations, are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year. Foreign currency trading transactions are translated at the rate ruling at the time of the transaction unless covered by a forward foreign exchange contract in which case the contracted rate is used. Those currency translation differences arising on the re-translation of the net assets in respect of overseas operations are shown as movements on reserves. Where these currency translation differences give rise to taxation consequences, these are also shown as movements on reserves. All other currency translation differences are recognised in the profit and loss account. Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill arising has been capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life. Useful economic lives are determined based on factors such as the market in which the business operates, the rate of change in the business environment or market, the reputation of the business, its past performance, and its future prospects. The estimates of useful economic lives are currently between five and ten years. Hire purchase contracts A significant proportion of the Group\\'s financing is provided by hire purchase contracts and finance leases. Throughout the financial statements the term hire purchase refers to hire purchase contracts, finance leases and sale and leaseback arrangements with financial institutions and suppliers. In accordance with FRS5: Reporting the substance of transactions the substance of the sale and leaseback arrangements is a secured loan and as such has been treated as a finance lease. Where these arrangements result in substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership resting with the Group, the assets are included in the balance sheet at cost less depreciation and the present value of future payments is shown as a liability. The interest element of these arrangements is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the arrangement in proportion to the balance of capital payments outstanding. Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill If a significant indicator of a possible impairment is noted, the need for any fixed asset impairment provision is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value or value in use. The value in use is determined from estimated discounted future cash flows. Discount rates used are based on the circumstances of the individual businesses. Investments Fixed asset investments are recognised at cost less any provision for impairment. Current asset investments are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value. AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT Long term incentive plan and employee share option scheme The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of share options or shares is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed rateably over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or shares determined at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable or the number of shares that the employee will ultimately receive. This estimate is revised at each balance sheet date and the difference is charged or credited to the profit and loss account, with a corresponding amount to equity. The proceeds received on exercise of the share options net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to equity. A charge is also recognised in respect of the employers\\' National Insurance contributions as a result of the Long Term Incentive Plan and share option scheme. The charge is based on the intrinsic value at the balance sheet date and is spread over the performance period. Operating leases Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term. Where significant operating lease incentives (such as a rent free period in respect of properties) are received they are considered as an integral part of the net payment agreed for the use of the leased asset and recognised over the period to the first rent review on a straight line basis. Pension and post retirement benefits Costs in respect of defined contribution type pension arrangements are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis in line with the amounts payable in respect of the accounting period. The Group has no defined benefit pension arrangements other than statutory retirement benefits that accrue to employees of Action SAM. The statutory retirement benefits relating to the employees of Action SAM, in substance, are similar to a defined benefit pension arrangement and an accrual for the full potential liability is made at each reporting date. Action SAM has no pension scheme assets. Restructuring, reorganisation, property lease, dilapidation and onerous contract provisions These provisions cover costs resulting from the strategic reorganisation and relocation of personnel across the Group, headcount reductions, dilapidation costs and onerous contracts. Provisions are recognised when a detailed formal plan has been drawn up and the main features of the plan have been announced to those affected by it. Where the time value of money would give rise to a material difference in the future cash outflows of the Group, the provisions are discounted at a rate to reflect the time value of money and the risks associated with the liability. Start up costs All costs relating to the start up of new operations are recognised in the profit and loss account as incurred. Stocks Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective stock. Tangible fixed assets and depreciation The cost of tangible assets includes those costs which are directly attributable to purchasing the assets and bringing them into working condition. The Group does not capitalise interest or internal costs as part of the cost of tangible assets. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated at rates estimated to write off the cost to nil residual value using the straight line method over the following estimated useful economic lives: Freehold land Freehold and long leasehold buildings Short leasehold buildings Hire stock Other plant and equipment Not depreciated years Remaining period of lease years years The Group reviews its depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances. When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the expected rate of technological developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used. Profits and losses arising from the normal replacement cycle of hire stock are considered to be in effect adjustments to previously charged depreciation and hence are included within operating results. Treasury shares Treasury shares held by the Company are treated as a deduction from equity at an amount equal to the purchase price paid. Treasury shares sold for cash are treated as a realised profit to the amount equal to the purchase price paid with any excess transferred to the share premium account. Treasury shares cancelled are treated as a reduction in issued share capital and a transfer to a capital redemption reserve. Turnover and revenue recognition Turnover represents the value of services and goods supplied to customers excluding Value Added Tax and other sales taxes, and net of customer discounts. Revenue is recognised as follows: Supply of services proportionally over the duration of the service or hire period, provided a right to consideration has been established. Supply of goods when the goods are dispatched to the customer. Revenue recognised in the profit and loss account but not yet invoiced is held on the balance sheet within Prepayments and Accrued Income. Revenue invoiced but not yet recognised in the profit and loss account is held on the balance sheet within Accruals and Deferred Income. Revenue from the disposal of fixed assets is not treated as turnover. Web site costs The Group uses web sites principally for sales and marketing purposes rather than directly for generating turnover. Accordingly all web site costs are recognised in the profit and loss account as incurred.

Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by dividing profit after taxation by the weighted average diluted number of ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares) during the year. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: the share options outstanding under the unapproved executive share option scheme, which do have a dilutive effect, and the contingently issuable shares under the long term incentive plan, none of which give rise to a dilution in the earnings per share because the performance conditions attached to them have not yet been met (see Note ). Adjusted earnings per share have been calculated by dividing profit after taxation and excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

The Directors continue to review the levels of provision held, taking into account the expected periods to market and assign the leases, and adjust the provision accordingly. (iii) Onerous contracts In the year ended the Directors of Avesco plc reviewed the supplier contracts of the Group and, given changes in technology and market conditions, considered it appropriate to provide for the ongoing sub-hire costs of certain assets hired from third parties.

See Note for details of shares allotted in the year. Share-based payment The Company operates an executive share option scheme, established in and a long term incentive plan (\"LTIP\"), established in In any year period no more than percent of Avesco\\'s issued share capital from time to time may be issued or put under option to be issued for the purposes of the LTIP and the share option scheme. No awards may be made under either scheme more than years after its adoption. Share option scheme At there were : ) options under the unapproved executive share option scheme at pence each. These options are exercisable between and The right to exercise these options was subject to a performance condition that has now been satisfied. These options have been valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model resulting in a charge to the profit and loss account of : ). The assumptions used in this calculation are as follows: Grant date Share price at grant date Exercise price Expected volatility Expected life Risk free rate Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 7 years % Long Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\") Under the LTIP, which it is proposed will in due course be operated in conjunction with an employee trust, awards are made to employees under which they can receive Avesco shares at no cost to themselves based on the achievement of a pre-determined and stretching performance condition. No individual may receive awards in any financial year with an aggregate value at the time of grant in excess of of the employee\\'s annual basic salary although this limit may increase to of the employee\\'s basic annual salary if the remuneration committee decides that exceptional circumstances exist. The performance condition applicable to the first awards of rights to shares made under the LTIP is that a cumulative adjusted earnings per share (calculated by dividing the consolidated Group profits of the period after taxation and after deducting minority interests and preference dividends and excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year) of at least is achieved over the three years ending The remuneration committee has discretion to adjust the earnings per share in relation to exceptional and/or non-recurring events. Subject to the rules of the LTIP and the fulfilment of the performance condition, of the shares will be released on the date of the preliminary announcement of the results of the Company for the year ending and, subject to continuing service of the award holder, of the shares will be released on the first anniversary of that announcement date or, if later, the date of the announcement by the Company of its results for the year ending For shares granted to employees under the LTIP, the fair value of the shares is measured at the market price of the Company\\'s shares, adjusted to take into account the terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted. As the performance conditions attached to the shares are not market performance related, the best estimate of fair value is considered to be market value at date of grant. No changes are subsequently made for changes in the share price after the grant date. The charge is spread over the term to vesting date. The table below presents the awards outstanding with an analysis of the movements in the number of awards during the year and the charge to the profit and loss account.

The Group does not trade in financial instruments. The main risks considered to arise from the Group\\'s use of financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Counterparty risk is only considered significant in the case of trade debtors and cash. The Group undertakes appropriate credit control procedures in respect of trade debtors and only makes short term cash deposits with major financial institutions. Foreign currency risk The Group operates extensively in the United States of America and Europe principally through its overseas operations but also through operations based in the United Kingdom. Overseas operations are funded either through local borrowings or loans from Avesco Finance Limited denominated in the overseas currency. Where loans are regarded as part of the Group\\'s net investment in the operation, in a comparable manner to share capital, any exchange gains or losses are recognised as movements on reserves. All other net foreign currency assets of Avesco Finance Limited are hedged using foreign currency overdrafts or forward foreign exchange contracts in the United Kingdom. In general the Group does not hedge the foreign currency risk arising from sales by an operation denominated in a currency other than its functional currency. In the majority of cases, substantial deposits on such sales are received at the time of the order and the remaining balances are, to a large extent, matched by overseas costs. The exceptions to this policy are generally related to the purchase of tangible assets or other large one-off transactions where the currency risk is usually hedged. The currency profile of the financial liabilities is determined by the funding needs of the Group\\'s operations. Interest rate risk It is the Group\\'s policy generally that financial instruments should carry a variable rate of interest. The Group monitors expectations of future interest rates but keeps the majority of its interest bearing financial liabilities carrying a variable rate of interest. This is regarded as providing a partial hedge against the economic business cycle and takes into consideration the strong cash flow from operations. It is the Group\\'s policy to undertake capital expenditures initially using overdraft facilities and then to finance these purchases in arrears using hire purchase facilities. This approach leads to competitive interest rates being secured and administration costs being reduced. Liquidity risk The Group monitors the maturity profile of its financial instruments on an ongoing basis. It is the Group\\'s policy to use bank loans and hire purchase obligations to keep a reasonable proportion of its net debt due after more than one year. Bank overdrafts are used for short term flexibility. At the percentage of net debt due after more than one year was ( 0%). The Group\\'s policy is to maintain a range of types of borrowing facilities from a number of major financial institutions. Financial assets or liabilities in this note exclude short term debtors and creditors. Long term debtors are also excluded. Included within debtors is in respect of the retention monies on the sale of Complete which is denominated in Sterling and earns interest at a variable rate based on the Bank of England base rate.

Completion and return of the form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending or voting at the Meeting in person. 3. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a `CREST Proxy Instruction\\') must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited\\'s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer\\'s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer\\'s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation ) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCO does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages.

If the Chairman, as a result of any proxy appointments, is given discretion as to how the votes the subject of those proxies are cast and the voting rights in respect of those discretionary proxies, when added to the interests in the Company\\'s securities already held by the Chairman, result in the Chairman holding such number of voting rights that he has a notifiable obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Chairman will make the necessary notifications to the Company and the Financial Services Authority. As a result, any member holding or more of the voting rights in the Company who grants the Chairman a discretionary proxy in respect of some or all of those voting rights and so would otherwise have a notification obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, need not make a separate notification to the Company and the Financial Services Authority. 6.

AVESCO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT NOTICE OF MEETING Resolutions and Reappointment and Remuneration of Auditors Resolution is a resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company\\'s auditors. Resolution is to authorise the Directors to determine the auditors\\' remuneration. Resolution Authority to allot shares The authority given to the Directors to allot further shares in the capital of the Company requires the prior authorisation of the shareholders in General Meeting under Section Companies Act Upon the passing of Resolution the Directors will have authority to allot the unissued ordinary share capital being shares of each, which is approximately of the current issued share capital. This authority will expire on The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority other than as may be required under the Company\\'s employee share schemes. Resolution Disapplication of pre-emption rights The passing of Resolution will give the Directors authority under Section Companies Act to allot, for cash, up to shares of each (being approximately of the current issued share capital) without being required first to offer such securities to existing shareholders in accordance with the statutory pre-emption rights. This authority will expire months from the date of the passing of the Resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next following Annual General Meeting of the Company. This authority will also extend to any subsequent sale of equity securities which have been held in treasury. The limits, which apply to this authority, will apply as a total to all and any allotments of shares and sales of treasury shares pursuant to this authority. The Resolution will give the Company greater flexibility when considering future opportunities. A disapplication of pre-emption rights in respect of of the issued share capital is approximately the same percentage as was approved at the EGM of the Company held in April A limit of of the issued share capital is considered appropriate having regard to the disproportionate level of costs that may be incurred by the Company in the case of a pre-emptive issue of less than and is consistent with market practice on AIM. However, the interests of existing shareholders will be protected as, except in the case of an issue to shareholders (or sale of treasury shares) in proportion to shareholdings or the allotment of shares under (or transfer of treasury shares pursuant to) the Company\\'s employee share schemes, the proportionate interests of shareholders cannot, without their consent, be reduced by more than by the issue for cash of new shares or sale of treasury shares. Other than as may be required under the Company\\'s employee share schemes, the Directors have no present intention to allot any part of the unissued share capital of the Company or, without the prior approval of the Company in general meeting, to make any issue which would effectively alter the control of the Company or the nature of its business. Resolution Authority to purchase shares The Articles of Association of the Company contain provision, with the authority of the shareholders, for the Company to make market purchases of its own shares. It is proposed that the Company be authorised to purchase up to approximately of its issued share capital subject to the limitations set out in Resolution The Directors intend to use up to the remaining from the sale of the 2waytraffic shares to undertake additional market purchases of the Company\\'s own shares although they only propose to do so if satisfied that such purchases would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of the shareholders generally. Following the introduction of the Company (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations certain listed companies can now, subject to certain restrictions, hold up to per cent. of their own shares acquired by way of market purchase in treasury, rather than cancelling them. The Company would consider holding any of its own shares which it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred by this Resolution as treasury shares. This would allow the Company to sell shares out of treasury, providing the Company with the ability to replenish its distributable reserves. No dividends will be paid on any shares held in treasury and no voting rights will attach to such shares. It would also be possible for the Company to transfer shares out of treasury pursuant to an employee share scheme.

(Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES ABTERRA is an emerging supply chain manager in the natural resources business, trading in iron ore, coking coal and coke. Abterra aims to differentiate itself through its core strategy of vertical integration and by pursuing sustainable long-term growth in the Chinese and international markets. In October General Nice Resources (Hong Kong) Limited acquired a majority stake in Abterra and became its controlling shareholder. Tapping on the competitive advantage of General Nice Resources (Hong Kong) Limited, Abterra is able to leverage on its parent company\\'s concrete branding and expertise in establishing a strong network in China, welcoming extensive investment opportunities. In September Abterra successfully gained shareholders\\' approval for the addition of the property and minerals businesses to its core trading business. The addition of the property business allows the Company to diversify into property investment, property holding and property development. The inclusion of the minerals business further enables the Company to branch into the business of owning and development of mines, including the mining, exploration, exploitation, production, sale and trading of minerals, resources and commodities. Addition of these new businesses strengthens Abterra\\'s ability to achieve long-term growth under different economic conditions and reinforces its strategy of vertical integration. Abterra the Latin translation of \"Fruits of the Earth\" has been listed on the SGX Mainboard since 4 ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT CHAIRMAN\\'S STATEMENT DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, On behalf of the Board of Directors of Abterra Ltd (\"Abterra\", or the \"Company\" and together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\"), I am pleased to present Abterra\\'s annual report for the financial year ended (\"FY2014\"). FY2014: Ensuring Business Sustainability During the year, we leveraged on our internal financial resources and wide network of trading partners to grow our iron ore trading and coal trading businesses organically. As a result of the Group\\'s efforts, revenue increased to S in FY2014 from S in FY2013. Gross profit improved to S in FY2014 from S in FY2013. Loss for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company totalled S in FY2014 compared to profit of S in FY2013. This decrease was mainly due to the provision for doubtful debts on deposits of S in FY2014 and the S increase in share of loss of associates from S in FY2013 to S in FY2014. Provision for doubtful debts was made on the deposits balance of S as the fair value of the security shared by the Group was lower than the outstanding balance. In addition, the increase in share of loss of associates was mainly due to the fair value losses recorded by Shanxi Fenxi Ruitai Zhengzhong Coal Limited as a result of the decrease in coal mine valuation. Loss per share for FY2014 was Singapore cents in FY2014, compared to earnings per share of Singapore cents in FY2013. Net asset value per share as at was Singapore cents compared to Singapore cents as at As part of our diversification strategy to strengthen Abterra\\'s ability to achieve long-term growth, the Group has been actively exploring growth opportunities in the regional real estate sector including but not limited to property investment, property holding and property development. In December Abterra entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with Full Winner Industrial (Overseas) Limited for the proposed acquisition of Smart Harmony Investment Limited (\"Smart Harmony\"). Smart Harmony owns a commercial property located in Beijing, People\\'s Republic of China (\"PRC\"). The proposed acquisition presents the Group with an opportunity to enter the property market in the PRC whilst providing Abterra with an alternative income stream. 5 ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES Outlook The Group remains cognisant of the challenging market outlook for its core trading business as major iron ore producers continue to boost supply of iron ore in an oversupplied global market1. Falling oil prices and a stronger United States dollar are also expected to apply downward pressure on iron ore prices in Nonetheless, the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute forecasted that domestic demand for steel in the PRC will grow to reach tonnes in Moving forward, the Group intends to continue to pursue its strategy of becoming a vertically integrated supply chain manager of resources to enhance shareholders\\' value in the long run. To ensure the sustained growth of its core business, Abterra will continue to optimise its internal resources and capitalise on its capabilities and established presence in the PRC market. On the property market front, the PRC property market is likely to stabilise in the upcoming year as the government implements tailored, market-based policies to guide stable and healthy development of the industry4. Regionally, outlook for the Asia Pacific property market is positive and expected to outperform the global average in according to a Asia Pacific Real Estates Outlook report by CBRE, a leading commercial property and real estate services adviser5. Going forward, Abterra will continue to explore new growth opportunities in the property sector to expand and augment its income stream. Appreciation On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all shareholders for their unwavering support and confidence in Abterra. We would also like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our directors and employees for their hard work and dedication which has contributed to the success of the Group. We look forward to your continued support in the coming years as we work diligently towards the growth of the business and achieve long-term growth.

Net asset value per share as at was Singapore cents compared to Singapore cents as at ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS In FY2014, the Group recorded revenue of S million, an increase of or S from S in FY2013. The increase was primarily due to the Group utilising financial resources to improve its iron ore trading business which recognised revenue of S in FY2014 compared to S in FY2013. The Group\\'s coal trading business contributed S to overall topline in FY2014. Cost of sales increased or S to S in FY2014 from S in FY2013. Consequently, gross profit improved or S to S in FY2014 from S in FY2013. Gross profit margin for FY2014 was compared to for FY2013. Other operating income decreased or S to S in FY2014 from S in FY2013. The decrease can be attributed mainly to the absence of S interest income earned from deposits paid in relation to the termination of a proposed acquisition of of the equity interest in Zuoquan Xinrui Metallurgy Mine Co. Ltd. in FY2013 and a one-off gain on cancellation of shares issued previously under the Hua Kok International Ltd\\'s scheme of arrangement which amounted to S million. The decrease in other operating income was also partly offset by the increase in foreign exchange gain amounted to S million. Other operating expenses increased or S to S in FY2014 from S in FY2013. This was mainly attributable to the fair value loss of S realised upon maturity of the Group\\'s structured deposit and provision for doubtful debts on deposits of S million. Finance costs decreased or S to S in FY2014 as compared to S in FY2013. This was largely attributable to the repayment of interest bearing borrowings during the financial year. Share of loss of associates in FY2014 was S million, compared to S in FY2013. This was mainly due to the increase in loss contributed by an associate company, Shanxi Fenxi Ruitai Zhengzhong Coal Limited. As a result of the above, loss for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company totalled S in FY2014, as compared to profit of S in FY2013. Loss per share was Singapore cents in FY2014, compared to earnings per share of Singapore cents in FY2013. Net asset value per share as at was Singapore cents, as compared with Singapore cents as at ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT OPERATING & FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES OUTLOOK The Group\\'s cash and bank balances as at remained at the similar level compared to that as at Inventories decreased from S as at to zero as at as the Group sold its entire inventory of coal during the financial year. Trade receivables decreased to S as at from S as at mainly due to less sales made near the end of the financial year. Other receivables, deposits and prepayments (inclusive of current and non-current assets) decreased to S as at from S as at The decrease was mainly attributable to the partial settlement of deposit of S paid in FY2013 for the proposed acquisition of of equity interest in Zuoquan Xinrui Metallurgy Mine Co., Ltd. and provision for doubtful debts on deposits of S million. As at the Group\\'s total current assets amounted to S with total current liabilities of S million. The Group\\'s current ratio increased to approximately for the financial year mainly due to the repayment of term loans and settlement of payables to the holding company during the financial period under review. According to the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, domestic demand for steel in the People\\'s Republic of China (\"PRC\" or \"China\") is forecasted to grow in to reach tonnes As major iron ore mining companies continue to expand production despite the current overcapacity globally, iron ore prices are likely to remain low in the year ahead Falling oil prices and the stronger United States dollar are also expected to apply downward pressure on iron ore prices in the upcoming year The Group will optimise its internal resources and tap its network of trading partners to support the growth of its core trading business. Abterra intends to continue its strategy of becoming a vertically integrated supply chain manager of resources and enhance shareholders\\' value in the long run.

(Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY As an emerging supply chain manager in the natural resources business, trading in iron ore, coking coal and coke, Abterra is committed to adopt and uphold best practices and standards in sustainability throughout our value chain. In our corporate social responsibility (\"CSR\") strategy and initiatives; we seek to align the interests of our stakeholders, our community and the environment. In the Group embarked on a new CSR initiative to give back to and serve the local community. We adopted Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home (the \"Home\") as our charity organisation and will continue to work closely with the Home to enhance the welfare of the residents in the Home. True to our core values of agility, reliability, integrity and professionalism, Abterra has always sought to maintain high standards of environmental sustainability and community involvement. On the operational front, in the Group continued to strengthen its sustainability initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of our mining operations. COMMUNITY OUTREACH We have adopted a holistic approach for our community outreach programmes and focused on engaging the aged, children and the underprivileged, in order to strengthen the Group\\'s ties with locals and help those in need. Over the course of the Group\\'s employees volunteered at the Home and worked closely with the pioneer generation who played a pivotal role in Singapore\\'s development. The Home is a private nursing home that is dedicated to providing healthcare services to aged residents from low and middle income families. As a private nursing home, the Home is highly dependent on volunteers and sponsorships. The Abterra team volunteered at the Home on a regular basis and assisted the residents with day-today activities such as feeding them, bringing them for a stroll or engaging them in conversations and games. Apart from the time spent at the Home, Abterra has also supplied them with equipment such as blenders and perishable food supplies. There are also plans in the pipeline to sponsor one year\\'s worth of selected perishable food and medical items for the residents. Rooted in the belief that children are the future of Singapore and it is important to provide them with a good environment to grow in, Abterra collaborated with the Canossaville Children\\'s Home as well. The Group was the sponsor of a tea party for the orphans. Apart from financial sponsorships, the Group also worked with Willing Hearts, a non-profit soup kitchen which provides daily meals and other support services to the underprivileged, the needy and other marginalised members of Singapore\\'s society. The Abterra team personally participated in the delivery of food to the underprivileged, including the elderly, adults and children in Singapore.

In there were no complaints relating to the environment or air quality, a testament of Abterra\\'s successful sustainability initiatives. The Group will continue to work closely with government agencies, industry bodies and business partners to further improve our environmental initiatives. ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Land Preparation Before clearing the land for waste stockpiles, a qualified expert would be hired to inspect the land for threatened flora and fauna. Existing topsoil stockpiles are also moved and consolidated before work commences to minimise erosion. Erosion and Sediment Control Runoff water is minimised to control erosion and the flow of sediments. All runoff is firstly diverted to sediment catch drains and subsequently the sediment catch dam. Cleared vegetation and silt fences are also placed in the catch drains to act as sediment traps which inhibit sediment flow and prevent breaching of the outer perimeter of the drains. Waste Management All general rubbish and contaminated materials are collected and disposed off in accordance with standards stipulated by industry regulators and local authorities. Hazardous Material Management Hazardous materials are stored in bounded containers and tanks. Material Safety Data Sheets which contains information on the potential hazards and how to work safely with the chemical products, as well as spill kits are also on site. Water Management To effectively manage surface water runoff with contaminated sediments, Abterra fitted catch drains with silt stop fencing and placed additional coarse overburden rock in catch drains. The silt stop fences are cleared of sediment regularly. Diversion drains are also installed to direct water away from topsoil stockpiles where necessary. These measures help to minimise the potential for off-site discharge of runoff. Surface water pollution is also controlled as all hydrocarbons are contained within bunded areas, storage sheds or in on-road vehicles to prevent contaminated water from flowing into the drainage system. Furthermore, all sediments that are carried within water flows are collected by the sediment catch dam. Air Quality Abterra has put in place dust control practices to ensure that dust generation from potential sources is minimised. The air quality is also frequently monitored. Some of the dust control practices include: Maintenance of trafficable and stockpile areas by spraying water when necessary; Application of water from the mobile water-cart to minimise potential dust generation from disturbed areas; Use of dust-suppressing sprays to prevent dust generation; and Ensuring that all trucks transporting iron ore are effectively covered to prevent dust generation. Noise Pollution Abterra keeps to the noise limits and to date, none of our sites have received formal complaints pertaining to noise pollution. Light Pollution Our mining operations are mostly restricted to daylight hours. During winter months, some artificial lighting is required for up to two hours in the early evening. However, these lights are not visible from neighbouring residences and will not cause any light pollution. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ABTERRA LTD.

There have been no significant changes in the nature of these activities during the financial year. The consolidated financial statements of the Group and statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company for the financial year ended were authorised for issue by Board of Directors on 2. Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act, Cap. and the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (\"FRS\") including related Interpretations of FRS (\"INT FRS\") and are prepared on historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the financial statement. The individual financial statements of each Group entity are measured and presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are presented in Singapore dollar (\" \") which is also the functional currency of the Company, and all values presented are rounded to the nearest thousand (\" \"), unless otherwise indicated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the Group\\'s application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Although these estimates are based on management\\'s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates. ABTERRA LTD.

ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Basis of consolidation The financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has power and the Group is (ii) able to use such power to (iii) affect its exposure, or rights, to variable returns from then through its involvement with them. The Group reassesses whether it controls the subsidiaries if facts and circumstance indicate that there are changes to the one or more of the three elements of control. When the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it still has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient, after considering all relevant facts and circumstances, to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Group considers, among others, the extent of its voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders, currently exercisable substantive potential voting rights held by all parties, rights arising from contractual arrangements and voting patterns at previous shareholders\\' meetings. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group up to the effective date on which control ceases, as appropriate. Intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cashflows relating to intragroup transactions are eliminated on consolidation. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as that of the Company. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Non-controlling interests are identified separately from the Group\\'s equity therein. On an acquisitionby-acquisition basis, non-controlling interests may be initially measured either at fair value or at their proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree\\'s identifiable net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests\\' share of subsequent changes in equity. Losses in the subsidiary are attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Changes in the Group\\'s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Any differences between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in the relative interests in the subsidiary and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company. When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investments retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under FRS Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity. ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Basis of consolidation (Continued) Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss that has been recognised in profit or loss in the Company\\'s separate financial statements. Business Combinations Business combinations from The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The acquiree\\'s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under FRS are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for noncurrent assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held-for-sale in accordance with FRS Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell. Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group\\'s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. The acquiree\\'s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under FRS are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with FRS Income Taxes and FRS Employee Benefits respectively; liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree\\'s share- based payment awards are measured in accordance with FRS Share-based Payment; and assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with FRS Non- current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Business Combinations (Continued) Business combinations from (Continued) The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year. Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset at the acquisition date and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over net acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the Group\\'s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree\\'s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer\\'s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. Business combinations before In comparison to the above mentioned requirements, the following differences applied: Business combinations were accounted for by applying the purchase method. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs. The non-controlling interest (formerly known as minority interest) was measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree\\'s identifiable net assets. Business combinations achieved in stages were accounted for as step acquisitions. Adjustments to those fair values relating to previously held interests were treated as a revaluation and recognised in equity. When the Group acquired a business, embedded derivatives separated from the host contract by the acquiree were not reassessed on acquisition unless the business combination resulted in a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modified the cash flows that would otherwise be required under the contract. Contingent consideration was recognised if, and only if, the Group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was probable and a reliable estimate was determinable. Subsequent measurements to the contingent consideration affected goodwill. Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, being the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not control or of joint control of those policies, and generally accompanying a shareholding of or more of the voting power. On acquisition of the associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group\\'s share of the net fair value of the associate identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group\\'s share of the net fair value of the associate identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the Group\\'s share of the associate\\'s profit or loss in the reporting period in which the investment is acquired. Investments in associates are carried at cost less any impairment loss that has been recognised in profit or loss in the Company\\'s separate financial statements. ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Associates (Continued) The results and assets and liabilities of an associate are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held-for-sale, in which case it is accounted for under FRS Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations from the date on which the investee become an associate. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group\\'s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment loss of individual investments. The Group\\'s share of losses in an associate in excess of the Group\\'s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group\\'s net investment in the associate) are not recognised, unless the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Distributions received from the associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Group\\'s interest in an associate is accounted for in accordance with the Group\\'s accounting policy for goodwill arising on such acquisitions (see above). Unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group\\'s interest in the associate. Unrealised losses are also eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no impairment. The Company has accounted for its investments in associates at cost in it separate financial statements. Property, plant and equipment Buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation, and where applicable, accumulated impairment losses. Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The cost of plant and equipment includes its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Dismantlement, removal or restoration costs are included as part of the cost of plant and equipment if the obligation for dismantlement, removal or restoration is incurred as a consequence of acquiring or using the plant and equipment. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Leasehold Buildings Furniture and equipment Motor vehicles Leasehold improvements years years years years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at the end of each financial year. The gain or loss, being the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, arising on disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss. Fully depreciated plant and equipment are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Impairment of non-financial tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets as at each reporting date to assess for any indication of impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, the Group also tests its intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use for impairment annually by comparing their respective carrying amounts with their corresponding recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss for the amount by which the asset\\'s carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase. Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair values at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method of an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the assets is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the profit or loss. Gain or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Intangible assets (Continued) Supplier contract Supplier contract acquired arising from consolidation based on valuation report is amortised based on the quantities consumed during the period over the total quantities of metric tons available under the supplier contract. Investment properties Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation, is measured initially at its cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at fair value and changes in the fair value are included in profit or loss for the year in which they arise. Costs of major renovations and improvements to the investment property to the investment property are capitalised as additions and the carrying amounts of the replaced components are written off to profit or loss. The costs of maintenance, repairs and minor improvement are charged to profit or loss when incurred. Upon its disposal or retirement, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the investment property is recognised in profit or loss. Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments (including all fees on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument. Income and expense are recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets All financial assets are recognised on a trade date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. They are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the nature and purpose for which these financial assets were acquired and is determined at the time of initial recognition. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Financial instruments (Continued) Financial assets (Continued) Financial asset at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) A financial asset is classified as FVTPL if the financial asset is either held for trading or is designated as such upon initial recognition. A financial asset is classified as held-for-trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term; or if it is part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments with a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking and which is managed by the Group; or if it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument or a financial guarantee contract. A financial asset which is not classified as held-for-trading may be designated as FVTPL upon initial recognition if the financial asset is managed as part of a group of financial instruments, with its performance being evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group\\'s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset. Loans and receivables The Group\\'s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, deposits and bank balances. Such loans and receivables are non-derivatives with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. Available-for-sale financial assets (AFS) Certain equity instruments and debt securities held by the Group are classified as AFS if they are not classified in any of the other categories. Subsequent to initial recognition, with the exception of unquoted equity instruments that are not carried at fair value as the fair value cannot be reliably measured, AFS are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in the availablefor-sale reserve with the exception of impairment losses, interests calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the available-for-sale reserve is included in profit or loss for the year. ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Financial instruments (Continued) Financial assets (Continued) Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds receivables. Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each financial year. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset\\'s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amounts of all financial assets are reduced by the impairment loss directly with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss. With the exception of available-for-sale equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. In respect of available-for-sale equity instruments, any subsequent increase in fair value after an impairment loss is recognised directly in equity. Financial liabilities and equity instruments Classification as debt or equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Financial instruments (Continued) Financial liabilities and equity instruments (Continued) Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Other financial liabilities Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, where applicable, using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for borrowing costs (see below). Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group\\'s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk such as foreign exchange forward contracts. Derivatives are initially recognised at their fair values at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair values at the end of each financial year. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair value changes on derivatives that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss when the changes arise. Inventories Inventories pertain to the coal held for sale. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the First-in, First-Out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. During the year, the cost of inventories recognised as an expense was : Nil). ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and bank balances which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Borrowings Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently accounted for at amortised costs using the effective interest method. Borrowings which are due to be settled within twelve months after the end of the reporting period are included in current borrowings in the statement of financial position even though the original term was for a period longer than twelve months and an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the end of the reporting period and before the financial statements are authorised for issue. Other borrowings due to be settled more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period are included in non-current borrowings in the statement of financial position. Leases Finance leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased assets to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction of production of qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group\\'s general policy on borrowing costs (please see above). Operating leases As lessee Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Leases (Continued) Operating leases (Continued) As lessor Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which user benefit derived from the leased asset is diminished. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straightline basis over the lease term. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the financial year, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. Changes in the estimated timing or amount of the expenditure or discount rate are recognised in profit or loss as they arise. Share based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in Note to the financial statements. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group\\'s estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At the end of the reporting period, the Group reviews its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share options reserve. ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group\\'s activities. Revenue is shown net of estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders\\' rights to receive payment have been established. Rental income Rental income from investment property is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Borrowing costs All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Employee leave entitlements Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the financial year. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Jobs credit scheme Cash grants received from the government in relation to the Jobs Credit Scheme are recognised as an offset against staff costs. Dividends Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim dividends are recorded in the financial year in which they are declared payable. Final dividends are recorded in the financial year in which dividends are approved by shareholders. Segment information Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the group of executive directors and the chief executive officer who make strategic decisions. Income tax Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or tax deductible. The Group\\'s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and subsidiaries operate by the end of the financial year. Deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each financial year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the financial year and based on the tax consequence that will follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the financial year, to recover or settle the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities except for the investment properties where investment properties measured at fair value are presented to be recovered entirely through sale. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Income tax (Continued) Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill or determining the excess of the acquirer\\'s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree\\'s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost. Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: when the sales tax that is incurred on purchases is not recoverable from the tax authorities, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included. Foreign currency transactions and translations Foreign currency transactions are translated into the individual entities\\' respective functional currencies at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each financial year, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing as of the end of the financial year. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the year except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. Exchange differences relating to assets under construction for future productive use, are included in the cost of those assets where they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings. For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group\\'s foreign operations (including comparatives) are expressed in Singapore dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the financial year. Income and expense items (including comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group\\'s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Foreign currency transactions and translations (Continued) On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities (including monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign entities), and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Critical accounting estimates, judgments and key sources of estimation The Group made judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that were not readily apparent from other sources in the application of the Group\\'s accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the estimates. Impairment of investments in subsidiaries At the end of each financial year, an assessment is made on whether there is objective evidence that the Company\\'s investments in subsidiaries are impaired. The management\\'s assessment is based on the estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating unit (\"CGU\") by forecasting the expected future cash flows for a period up to years, using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The Company\\'s carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries as at was : ). Estimated impairment of investment in associates The Group has substantial investments in associates which involved in the exploration and evaluation assets for its mining operation in China whereby the carrying amount of the exploration assets is dependent on the successful development and commercial exploitation. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment if sufficient data exists to determine the technical feasibility and commercial viability or facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. In making this judgment, the Group evaluates the recoverable amount using the value-in-use based on the third party valuation report which was performed by the professional valuer. At the Group\\'s and Company\\'s carrying amount of the investment in associates amounted to approximately and : and ) respectively. Estimated impairment of financial assets and available-for-sale The Group assesses impairment of the above-mentioned assets wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use) of the assets is estimated to determine the impairment loss. In making this judgment, the Group evaluates the recoverable amount using the value-in-use based on the third party valuation report which was performed by the professional valuer. At the Group\\'s and Company\\'s carrying amount of the available-for-sale financial assets amounted to approximately : ) and : ) respectively. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Critical accounting estimates, judgments and key sources of estimation (Continued) Estimated fair value of investment properties Investment properties are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, determined annually by independent professional valuers on the highest and best-use basis. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in the profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Fair value gain of the investment properties amounting to approximately Nil : ) is recognised during the year as disclosed in Note to the financial statements. At the Group\\'s and Company\\'s carrying amount of investment properties amounted to approximately : ). Impairment and collectability of trade and other receivables The Group follows the guidance of FRS to determine when trade and other receivables are impaired. This determination requires certain level of judgement. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for individually significant debtors and collectively for debtors which are not individually significant. The Group evaluates, among other factors, financial status of the debtors, any changes in the collection status and changes in industry conditions that affect the debtors. Trade and other receivables that are collectively evaluated for impairment are based on historical loss experience for receivables with similar credit risk characteristics. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating potential impairment loss are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. Impairment loss of the Group\\'s and Company\\'s trade and other receivables amounted to approximately and : Nil and ) as at the end of the reporting period are disclosed in Note and to the financial statements respectively. The carrying amount of trade and other receivables of the Group and Company as at are approximately and : and ) respectively. Income tax The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the group-wide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred income tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. The income tax liabilities of the Group and Company as at are approximately and : Nil and Nil) respectively. ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Critical accounting estimates, judgments and key sources of estimation (Continued) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the property, plant and equipment\\'s estimated economic useful lives. Management estimates the useful lives of these assets to be within to years. Changes in the expected level of usage could impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore, future depreciation charges could be revised. The carrying amount of the Group\\'s property, plant and equipment at the end of the reporting period is disclosed in Note to the financial statements. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets The Group has commenced its iron ore trading operation since May in which the Group has been utilising a portion of the plant and equipment and the intangible assets to generate revenue. Based on the valuation report prepared by a third party independent professional valuer, the net present value expected to generate from this operation exceeds the carrying amount of the plant and equipment and the intangible assets. As a result, no impairment was made as at Determination of functional currency The Group measures foreign currency transactions in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. In determining the functional currencies of the respective entities in the Group, judgement is required to determine the currency that mainly influences sales prices of goods and services and of the country whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determines the sales prices of its goods and services. The functional currencies of the entities in the Group are determined based on the local management\\'s assessment of the principal economic environment in which the entities operate and the respective entities\\' process of determining sales prices. 3.

(Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED Financial risk management Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group\\'s activities expose itself to a variety of financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The key financial risks include market risk (which comprises foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group\\'s overall business strategies, tolerance of risk and general risk management philosophy are determined by Board of Directors in accordance with prevailing economic and operating conditions. Market risk Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises from a change in foreign currency exchange rate, which is expected to have adverse effect on the Group in the current reporting period and in future years. The Group\\'s main foreign exchange risk arises from foreign currency denominated sales and purchases, and operating expenses. The exposure is managed by natural hedges that arise from offsetting between sales receipts and purchases, and operating expenses disbursement that are denominated in foreign currencies and the utilization of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the Company\\'s foreign currency exposures. Further details on the forward exchange contracts can be found in Note to the financial statements. Companies within the Group, including the Group\\'s associates maintain their books in their respective functional currencies. Profits and net assets of overseas companies are translated into Singapore dollar, the Group\\'s reporting currency for consolidation purposes. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the functional currencies and Singapore dollar will have an impact on the Group. The Group also maintains foreign currency bank accounts for operating purposes. ABTERRA LTD.

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower.

The primary source of the Group\\'s interest rate risk is its borrowings from financial institutions in Singapore. The Group\\'s policy is to manage its interest cost using a combination of fixed and variable interest rate borrowings, where applicable. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED Financial risk management (Continued) Financial risk management objectives and policies (Continued) Market risk (Continued) (ii) Interest rate risk (Continued) The Group has adequate credit facilities to ensure necessary liquidity as provided from the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group manages its interest rate risks on its interest income by placing the cash balances in varying maturities and interest rate terms. Interest rate risk sensitivity The financial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing except for cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as set out in the table below, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates. Assets Cash and cash equivalents Rate Group \\' Company \\' Floating Liabilities Term loans Floating Term loans Fixed The Group and Company\\'s borrowings at variable rates on which effective hedges have not been entered into, are denominated in USD. If the interest rates increase or decrease by ( %) with all other variables including tax rate being held constant, the Group and Company\\'s profit/(loss) after income tax will be lower or higher by and respectively : and respectively) as a result of higher or lower interest expense on these borrowings. Liquidity risk The Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by management to finance the Group\\'s operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses including the servicing of financial obligations. The following tables detail the remaining contractual maturity for non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group and Company can be required to pay. ABTERRA LTD.

ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED Financial risk management (Continued) Financial risk management objectives and policies (Continued) Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group manages such risks by dealing with a diversity of credit-worthy counterparties to mitigate any significant concentration of credit risk. Credit policy includes assessing and evaluation of existing and new customers\\' credit reliability and monitoring of receivable collections. The Group places its cash and cash equivalents with creditworthy institutions. Trade receivables are generally on days to days term. As the Group and Company does not hold any collateral, the maximum exposure to credit risk for each class of financial instruments is the carrying amount of that class of financial instruments presented on the statement of financial position. The credit risk for trade receivables based on the information provided to key management is as follows: By geographical areas: Singapore Macau Indonesia Group \\' Company \\' Total The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, including amount due from related parties, represent the Group\\'s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. No other financial assets carry a significant exposure to credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are placed with reputable local financial institutions. Therefore, credit risk arises mainly from the inability of its customers to make payments when due. The amounts presented in the statement of financial position are net of allowances for impairment of trade receivables, estimated by management based on prior experience and the current economic environment. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED Financial risk management (Continued) Financial risk management objectives and policies (Continued) Credit risk (Continued) The age analysis of trade receivables is as follows: Not past due and not impaired Group \\' Past due but not impaired: Past due over months Gross trade receivables Company \\' At the end of the reporting period, ( %) of the Group\\'s trade receivables were due from major third party customer : 1 major third party customer in China). Fair values of assets and liabilities The carrying amounts of cash and bank balances, trade and other receivables and payables and amount due from subsidiaries are reasonable approximation of fair values due to the relatively shortterm maturity of these financial instruments. The fair values of applicable financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and which trade in active liquid markets that the Group can access at the measurement date markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices (unadjusted) (Level of fair value hierarchy); in the absence of quoted market prices, the fair values of the other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined using the other observable, either directly or indirectly, inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in non-active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (Level of fair value hierarchy). in the absence of observable inputs, the fair values of the remaining financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivatives instruments) are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models (Level of fair value hierarchy). the fair value of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices (Level of fair value hierarchy). Where such prices are unavailable, discounted cash flow analysis is used, based on the applicable yield curve of the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives (Level of fair hierarchy). ABTERRA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED Financial risk management (Continued) Financial risk management objectives and policies (Continued) Fair values of assets and liabilities (Continued) Fair value measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. At Non-financial assets Investment property Commercial Level Group and Company Level Level \\' Total At Financial assets Derivative financial assets Forward foreign exchange contract Other financial asset at fair value through profit or loss Level Group and Company Level Level \\' Total Non-financial assets Investment property Commercial Level Valuation techniques are used for the determination of the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined using quoted forward currency rates at the reporting date. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Level Investment property The commercial investment properties were valued using the direct comparison and income method which estimates the properties\\' fair value based on comparable transactions and used in combination with term and reversion method. The direct comparison and income approach estimates the property\\'s fair value based on comparable transactions. The term and reversion method measures the fair value of the property by taking into account the rental income derived from the existing lease with due allowance for the reversionary income potential of the leases, which are then capitalised into the value at appropriate rates. ABTERRA LTD. (Incorporated in Singapore) AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED Financial risk management (Continued) Financial risk management objectives and policies (Continued) Fair values of assets and liabilities (Continued) A significant increase/(decrease) in the estimated market rent per annum and price per square metres would result in a significant increase/(decrease) in the fair value of the investment property. Correspondingly, a significant increase/(decrease) in term yields and reversionary yields will result in a decrease/(increase) in fair value of the investment property. The table below states the information about fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs: Description Investment properties: Fair value at Valuation technique Unobservable input Commercial Direct comparison Yield adjustments based on and income method valuation report Movements in Level assets and liabilities measured at fair value The following table presents the reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on significant unobservable inputs (Level ): Balance at beginning of year and end of year Investment properties Valuation policies and procedures The Group\\'s Financial Controller (\"FC\") oversees the Group\\'s financial reporting valuation process and is responsible for setting and documenting the Group\\'s valuation policies and procedures and reports to the Group\\'s Audit Committee. It is the Group\\'s policy to engage external valuation experts to perform all significant financial reporting valuations using valuation models and significant unobservable inputs. The FC is responsible for selecting and engaging valuation experts that possess the relevant credentials and knowledge on the subject of valuation, valuation methodologies, and FRS fair value measurement guidance. He also reviews the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and assumptions adopted and evaluates the appropriateness and reliability of the inputs (including those developed internally by the Group) used in the valuations. At least on an annual basis, the FC evaluates all significant changes in fair value measurements for reasonableness. Key drivers of the changes are identified and assessed for reasonableness against relevant information from independent sources, or internal sources, if necessary and appropriate. The analysis and results of the external valuations and then reported to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis who then performs a high-level independent review of the valuation process and results and recommends if any revisions need to be made before presenting the results to the Board of Directors for approval.
